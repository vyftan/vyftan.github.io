<h2 id="ee5137_sp2021">Review Quotes for EE5137 Stochastic Processes (Spring 2021)</h2>
<p>"Whether it is preparation for teaching or consultation after class, Professor Vincent is an very excellent teacher. In particular, handwriting notes are very detailed, which touched me the most. I think professor have made very sufficient preparations in teaching. In the course of learning stochastic process, I not only mastered a lot of knowledge points, but also deeply understood the application and derivation of them. I believe that I will never forget the way of thinking that the professor taught me in this life. In a word, I am very glad to nominate him being selected for teaching awards."</p>

<p>"Prof Vincent articulates his ideas very clearly, teaches a very engaging class, points out key heuristics principles for approaching questions in stochastic processes, looks out for his students to ensure they can keep up with the material and are not confused. In his lessons, he does not neglect the mathematical technicalities (to ensure complete rigour) while at the same time, keeping the discussion relevant and centred around the practical applications. Prof Vincent is also not afraid to field questions asked by students. I could not have asked for a better teacher. "</p>

<p>"He is the best teacher I have meet in university so far. Can feel his passion in teaching, he will try his best to make the class interesting. From his class I can feel that he real put a lot of effort in teaching the class."</p>
