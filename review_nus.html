<h2 id="ee2012_sp2022">Review Quotes for EE2012A Analytical Methods in ECE (Spring 2022)</h2>		

<p>One of the best prof that i have stumbled upon. Cares for his students deeply and provides office hours to ensure we understood the concept well. Goes the extra mile to explain and provide ample revision materials and notes, which helps us greatly in our learning. The module is dry, however with prof vincent teachings, captivates me more to learn about the module, and make it as interesting as possible. </p>	
	
<p>I can tell that Vincent always invests a lot of time in his teaching. He is always well–prepared for classes, able to quickly locate students' weaknesses from our responses, and try to help everyone including those who are left behind in the subject.

</p>	
	
<p>Prof Vincent teaches in a very clear and concise manner, while explaining various concepts with strong substantiation. It is evident that he places strong emphasis on preparing well for the lesson so that a good amount of content can be covered in each lesson. Especially for EE students who may not have as much mathematical background, EE5137 has been taught in a manner which helps to expand upon such abilities. Prof Vincent is extremely responsive and helpful when it comes to providing additional resources and assistance via both email and office hours. Overall, his module has been enriching and definitely covered the various aspects of stochastic processes in a manner which has been built–up over the semester.  </p>	

<p>Prof Vincent is amazing at explaining and answering queries, he is truly a master of this content. He answers so many queries and is available for multiple consultations whether it is via email or outside lesson hours. It is amazing how he is committed to really helping students way beyond what is required. </p>		

<p>He is the best teacher I ever met. Prof. Vincent cares alot about the teaching and students. His lecture is like a performance, I enjoyed alot. He sparked my interest in statistics and changed my further study direction. I feel very lucky that I took this course. </p>	

<p>The lecturer is one of the best professors I have met who explains difficult contents clearly in great details. He is also very active in providing additional notes and clarifications even after the lecture. He is very responsible to all his students. </p>	

<p>Prof is very responsible for teaching and always solving doubts timely and patiently.I think the course is one of the best course I have taken in this semester.

<p>Professor Tan is very good at communicating with us, always happy to reply to any questions. His lectures are well prepared and structured. He's also very dedicated to solving our off–class questions, very responsive. He's one of my favorite professors in NUS. </p>	
	
<h2 id="ma4270_fa2021">Review Quotes for MA4270 Data Modeling and Computation (Fall 2021)</h2>	

<p>I have learnt a lot more from him than many other ML modules combined.</p>
	
<p>Vincent deserves the honor of "best teacher" at NUS. He is really passionate and knowledgeable in the Machine Learning area. Taking his module really opens my eyes. Although the speed is quite fast and I have to spend a lot of time in this course to barely catch his steps, I am willing to devote time to this course from the bottom of my heart, since my passion for Machine Learning has been stimulated.</p>
	
<p>As a student who has little experience in classical machine learning, I am very grateful that Prof. Tan makes this module understandable for me, This module nurtures my interest and inspires me to explore deeper in this field. Therefore, I would like to nominate Prof. Tan for teaching awards. </p>	

<p>Prof Vincent is one of the 2 most enthusiastic, hard–working and hilarious professors I had the privilege to learn from at NUS. His ability to articulate complicated concepts in concise and thought–provoking manners is top–notch. I learnt a lot from him, not just about the topics of MA4270, but generally he really showed us what it meant to do work with passion and great accountability – by the way he prepared lecture notes and complementary readings, prepared questions, engaged us during lectures and being responsive to our questions. </p>	
	
<p>In lecture, he is very passionate in class, which can well arouse the students' emotions and keep the students focused in class. And he will introduce some classic and simple examples to deepen our understanding of the algorithm. What's more, he correlate the theory with practice. What make me a deep impression is how to rank the best players in tennis by EM. Prof he shows us that wow this is how math works exactly step by step, which is so charming. And I really like the office hours. </p>	
	
<p>Coming from an algorithms background (I've taken most of the 5000–level algorithm modules in SoC), algorithms are well–grounded in proofs. Machine learning on the other hand, always seemed like rubbish to me, because people often tune parameters and it works well and they give themselves a pat on the back and there isn't really a good reason why. This module changed my perspective on that, thanks.</p>	
	
<p>Prof Vincent taught the module of MA4270 with great enthusiasm. He was very passionate about his field of study and was definitely a module that was interesting. Personally, I enjoyed the real–world application of the module as it allows us to explore outside the scope of what is being taught in the classroom. The workload for this module is higher than the usual load of a normal module that I have taken in NUS and a suggestion is not have so many components and consolidate them so that students can focus on a part of the module. Having said that, I do enjoy the ideas being discussed during the lectures and the open culture of being able to ask questions. (This is especially so as Prof Vincent makes it a point to stop at certain portion and ask if anyone is in doubt). Furthermore, the quick recap of proofs and ideas helps me consolidate what has been taught and I found it to be extremely helpful. In my opinion, the most enjoyable part of the module was that I was given the opportunity to write a term paper on a dataset that interests me the most! Buses. Having the freedom to do so meant that I had could find real–world application to the theory that has been taught. It was definitely a steep learning process to source, think and present the term paper in a concise and interesting way. But I find it useful not just in school but also as I look to find a job (as it can be a starting point for a conversation during an interview). I will recommend Prof’s Vincent’s module in Data Modelling and Computation as I find it extremely applicable to the outside world and worthwhile to learn under the prof himself. Many thanks for the semester and the interesting ideas being discussed in the classroom! </p>		

<h2 id="ee5137_sp2021">Review Quotes for EE5137 Stochastic Processes (Spring 2021)</h2>
<p>Whether it is preparation for teaching or consultation after class, Professor Vincent is an very excellent teacher. In particular, handwriting notes are very detailed, which touched me the most. I think professor have made very sufficient preparations in teaching. In the course of learning stochastic process, I not only mastered a lot of knowledge points, but also deeply understood the application and derivation of them. I believe that I will never forget the way of thinking that the professor taught me in this life. In a word, I am very glad to nominate him being selected for teaching awards.</p>

<p>Prof Vincent articulates his ideas very clearly, teaches a very engaging class, points out key heuristics principles for approaching questions in stochastic processes, looks out for his students to ensure they can keep up with the material and are not confused. In his lessons, he does not neglect the mathematical technicalities (to ensure complete rigour) while at the same time, keeping the discussion relevant and centred around the practical applications. Prof Vincent is also not afraid to field questions asked by students. I could not have asked for a better teacher.</p>

<p>He is the best teacher I have meet in university so far. Can feel his passion in teaching, he will try his best to make the class interesting. From his class I can feel that he real put a lot of effort in teaching the class.</p>
	
<p>He comes to class incredibly well–prepared. He is also an extremely sharp and clear thinker. He never fails to impart new insights with each lecture. He is also patient and willing to talk about concepts that are beyond the scope of the course. Overall, an excellent educator! <p>	

<h2 id="ee2211_sp2021">Review Quotes for EE2211 Introduction to Machine Learning  (Spring 2021)</h2>

<p>Professor Tan is very dedicated and passionate about what he is teaching. He goes the extra mile to compile a book/guide that helps students to be equipped with more information. He is very willing to clarify any doubts in class and even in consultation sessions. He attends Lectures (Zoom) even though he is not teaching in any of them (the lectures), to understand what the students are learning in the Lecture. I think that this is him going the extra mile to provide quality tutorials for his students as well. He shares tutorial answers to students one day before tutorial so that we can follow the codes and not be lost. I really thank Prof for being very inspirational and motivational. Thank you for encouraging me to push through this new module that is very different from the other mods im learning.</p>

<p>Effectively synthesizes theory with practical applications. Goes the extra mile (or ten) in terms of preparing effective teaching materials and tailoring content to students' needs. Engages with students continuously; encourages collaboration among students and answers queries promptly and thoroughly. I found myself gaining new insights from each tutorial, no matter how tenuous my grasp of the concept being discussed.</p>
	
<p>He provided his own notes to his classes and also have a website that consolidates all the tutorial notes, lecture notes. He is very enthusiastic in teaching and goes out of the way to help his students, even hosting bonus tutorials for QnA for slow learners. He also tried to pick up Telegram to communicate with his classes 24/7 which is a huge commitment and respect I have for him.</p>

<p>Vincent is an extremely good teacher who is not only very knowledgeable about the subject but also effectively explains the concepts. He is also very approachable. He goes beyond what's required of him by revising the concepts in the lecture, conducting regular consultations as well as being always available via email or telegram. His classes are also fun and engaging. He patiently answers all our questions. He makes us enjoy the subject by linking the concepts with real–world applications. Despite having e–learning this sem, his classes were effective and in fact even better than traditional face–to–face classes as the tutorials are recorded.<p>	
	
<p>Prof Tan is very helpful even outside of lesson timings. He is able to explain concepts very clearly during his tutorials and would not hesitate to render us help when we need them. He would also ask us for feedback regarding his teaching so that he can improve on himself, which I feel is not something that most tutors would do.</p>

<p>Very nice and friendly. goes the extra mile to ensure our learning and understanding of module. Willing to give consultations to students on his own time and very patient with slow learning students. Writes his own notes to ensure that we have additional knowledge in addition to the lecture and willing to share with the whole cohort. <p>

<p>Prof Vincent is an extremely dedicated lecturer who comes well-prepared for every class. He also constantly gathers feedback from students with regards to his teaching and makes improvements to his teaching, such as giving more examples and providing more elaboration when needed. By writing on the board instead of using slides, the pace also slows down so that students can catch the content. The uploaded handwritten notes are also very useful as students can focus on the lecture instead of copying notes during lecture. He is also a friendly and approachable lecturer who encourages students to ask questions and clarify their understanding. Throughout the duration of module, his enthusiasm towards the subject was apparent and has positively influenced our interest towards the subject. Even though some of the 'cool' concepts are not so easy to understand initially, the lecturer manages to simplify them so that students at the undergraduate level can better understand the ideas. The lecturer also encourages students to explore beyond the lecture content, by uploading further readings based upon the foundation taught in lecture. In addition, he is the one of the most dedicated professors I've seen in NUS Math, hence the nomination. <p>	
	
<p>Vincent is an extremely ambitious lecturer, who provides a large set of material to his students, writes outstanding notes at the board in the lecture, provides the relevant material in an understandable way and is able to point out the most relevant points. Furthermore, he is able to connect the content of the lecture to his own research and rises interest. <p>	
	
<p> The is the best math module I have ever taken. The prof is well prepared and he also design computational exercise and term paper assignment to us where we can implement and utilize the theoretical knowledge we have learned <p>
