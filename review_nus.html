<h2 id="ee5137_sp2021">Review Quotes for EE5137 Stochastic Processes (Spring 2021)</h2>
<p>"Whether it is preparation for teaching or consultation after class, Professor Vincent is an very excellent teacher. In particular, handwriting notes are very detailed, which touched me the most. I think professor have made very sufficient preparations in teaching. In the course of learning stochastic process, I not only mastered a lot of knowledge points, but also deeply understood the application and derivation of them. I believe that I will never forget the way of thinking that the professor taught me in this life. In a word, I am very glad to nominate him being selected for teaching awards."</p>

<p>"Prof Vincent articulates his ideas very clearly, teaches a very engaging class, points out key heuristics principles for approaching questions in stochastic processes, looks out for his students to ensure they can keep up with the material and are not confused. In his lessons, he does not neglect the mathematical technicalities (to ensure complete rigour) while at the same time, keeping the discussion relevant and centred around the practical applications. Prof Vincent is also not afraid to field questions asked by students. I could not have asked for a better teacher. "</p>

<p>"He is the best teacher I have meet in university so far. Can feel his passion in teaching, he will try his best to make the class interesting. From his class I can feel that he real put a lot of effort in teaching the class."</p>

<h2 id="ee2211_sp2021">Review Quotes for EE2211 Introduction to Machine Learning  (Spring 2021)</h2>

<p>"Professor Tan is very dedicated and passionate about what he is teaching. He goes the extra mile to compile a book/guide that helps students to be equipped with more information. He is very willing to clarify any doubts in class and even in consultation sessions. He attends Lectures (Zoom) even though he is not teaching in any of them (the lectures), to understand what the students are learning in the Lecture. I think that this is him going the extra mile to provide quality tutorials for his students as well. He shares tutorial answers to students one day before tutorial so that we can follow the codes and not be lost. I really thank Prof for being very inspirational and motivational. Thank you for encouraging me to push through this new module that is very different from the other mods im learning."</p>
	
<p>"he's a great teacher who always tries to help us as much as possible by answering all questions, providing notes etc. he also tries to make sure we understand the content."<p>
	
<p>"Vincent was very passionate and able import and simplify complex machine learning concepts into something understandable for the students. Furthermore, he goes above and beyond as an educator." <p>	

<h2 id="ee2211_fa2021">Review Quotes for EE2211 Introduction to Machine Learning (Fall 2020)</h2>
	
<p>"He provided his own notes to his classes and also have a website that consolidates all the tutorial notes, lecture notes. He is very enthusiastic in teaching and goes out of the way to help his students, even hosting bonus tutorials for QnA for slow learners. He also tried to pick up Telegram to communicate with his classes 24/7 which is a huge commitment and respect I have for him."</p>

<p>"Prof Tan is very helpful even outside of lesson timings. He is able to explain concepts very clearly during his tutorials and would not hesitate to render us help when we need them. He would also ask us for feedback regarding his teaching so that he can improve on himself, which I feel is not something that most tutors would do."</p>

<p>"Very nice and friendly. goes the extra mile to ensure our learning and understanding of module. Willing to give consultations to students on his own time and very patient with slow learning students. Writes his own notes to ensure that we have additional knowledge in addition to the lecture and willing to share with the whole cohort." <p>
						
<h2 id="ee5137_sp2020">Review Quotes for  EE5137 Stochastic Processes (Spring 2020)</h2>

<p>He has improved my understanding of topics of interest, and he is a true passionate person who follows his field closely, and updates us on ongoing events in his field. He was willing to answer my questions even when I came from a background of limited probability. Thank you very much, Prof Vincent! <p>	

<p>Prof Vincent is a highly capable and dedicated teacher. He has the difficult role of translating the advanced mathematical content of the module into a form that can be understand by a broad diversity of students, and plays the role excellently, while still being able to connect the theory to various applications. His clear and systematic teaching helps us to overcome the difficult content in this module, and increases our interest in the subject.<p>
	
<p>Vincent's compelling lecture notes and mesmerising teaching style has attracted a lot of students who are truly eager to learn math in the engineering faculty to his class. He's classes are usually highly interactive and engaging: despite the difficult materials, it's very hard to loose attention at his class. Homework problems are very well designed and intellectual entertaining.<p>
	
<h2 id="ma3110_fa2019">Review Quotes for MA3110 Mathematical Analysis II (Fall 2019)</h2>	

<p>Dedicated, passionate and very effective teacher. 1. Explains concept very very clearly, he will not skip steps like the lecture notes, and will explain the intuition for each step, and to solve the problems in general. 2. He will also give summaries for solving the problem again after explaining, which is very helpful in consolidating the learning and when you have gaps in understanding for certain steps. 3. Will not make me feel stupid! The way he describes his thought process makes me feel like we potentially get stuck at the same places and he teaches how to get over those. 4. Very easy to follow his lectures, his pace is just right and he goes through everything line by line on the board. (Normally it is difficult for me to follow other lectures because I can't multi task reading then notes/slides and listening at the same time, so I like how everything is in sync) 5. Shares interesting problems outside of lecture notes that gets me more interested in the subject and helps understand the lecture content more. <p>

<p>Good at explaining concepts. Patient and knowledgeable. Answer all sorts of questions, even those that are beyond the syllabus.<p>
	
<p>Yan Fu is an effectively lecturer that is able to deliver the learning objectives. Furthermore, he prepares additional notes that are both interesting and insightful.<p>

<p>He can explain the intuition thoroughly, and find the key point of the content. He is keen on research.<p>	

<h2 id="ee5137_fa2018">Review Quotes for EE5137 Stochastic Processes (Fall 2018)</h2>	

<p>It is able to see that the professor has spent a lot of time to prepare every lesson's material. And designed exercise problems carefully to help student to understand what has been taught. Great teaching style, logical and fluent. He is also very enthusiastic about what he is teaching that inspires student to think beyond what is in the notes. <p>
	
<p>He is excellent at teaching. His classes are exciting and clear. I think he is one of the best teachers I have seen.<p>	
	
<p>Vincent is very energetic and teaches in a way that I am able to stay alert during the Friday evening lectures. This is in itself a great feat. Besides this, he has a clear structure, to-the-point explanations that instantly make everything clearer, and if you still don't understand, he can explain it in another way. I'm not exaggerating when I say that his teaching was a highlight of this semester, and I would like to thank him for relaying the subject in such a good way and making me interested in pursuing it further.<p>
