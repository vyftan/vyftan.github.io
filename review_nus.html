<h2 id="ee5137_sp2021">Review Quotes for EE5137 Stochastic Processes (Spring 2021)</h2>
<p>"Whether it is preparation for teaching or consultation after class, Professor Vincent is an very excellent teacher. In particular, handwriting notes are very detailed, which touched me the most. I think professor have made very sufficient preparations in teaching. In the course of learning stochastic process, I not only mastered a lot of knowledge points, but also deeply understood the application and derivation of them. I believe that I will never forget the way of thinking that the professor taught me in this life. In a word, I am very glad to nominate him being selected for teaching awards."</p>

<p>"Prof Vincent articulates his ideas very clearly, teaches a very engaging class, points out key heuristics principles for approaching questions in stochastic processes, looks out for his students to ensure they can keep up with the material and are not confused. In his lessons, he does not neglect the mathematical technicalities (to ensure complete rigour) while at the same time, keeping the discussion relevant and centred around the practical applications. Prof Vincent is also not afraid to field questions asked by students. I could not have asked for a better teacher. "</p>

<p>"He is the best teacher I have meet in university so far. Can feel his passion in teaching, he will try his best to make the class interesting. From his class I can feel that he real put a lot of effort in teaching the class."</p>

<h2 id="ee2211_sp2021">Review Quotes for EE2211 Introduction to Machine Learning  (Spring 2021)</h2>

<p>"Professor Tan is very dedicated and passionate about what he is teaching. He goes the extra mile to compile a book/guide that helps students to be equipped with more information. He is very willing to clarify any doubts in class and even in consultation sessions. He attends Lectures (Zoom) even though he is not teaching in any of them (the lectures), to understand what the students are learning in the Lecture. I think that this is him going the extra mile to provide quality tutorials for his students as well. He shares tutorial answers to students one day before tutorial so that we can follow the codes and not be lost. I really thank Prof for being very inspirational and motivational. Thank you for encouraging me to push through this new module that is very different from the other mods im learning."</p>
	
<p>"he's a great teacher who always tries to help us as much as possible by answering all questions, providing notes etc. he also tries to make sure we understand the content."<p>
	
<p>"Vincent was very passionate and able import and simplify complex machine learning concepts into something understandable for the students. Furthermore, he goes above and beyond as an educator." <p>	

<h2 id="ee2211_fa2021">Review Quotes for EE2211 Introduction to Machine Learning (Fall 2020)</h2>
	
<p>"He provided his own notes to his classes and also have a website that consolidates all the tutorial notes, lecture notes. He is very enthusiastic in teaching and goes out of the way to help his students, even hosting bonus tutorials for QnA for slow learners. He also tried to pick up Telegram to communicate with his classes 24/7 which is a huge commitment and respect I have for him."</p>

<p>"Prof Tan is very helpful even outside of lesson timings. He is able to explain concepts very clearly during his tutorials and would not hesitate to render us help when we need them. He would also ask us for feedback regarding his teaching so that he can improve on himself, which I feel is not something that most tutors would do."</p>

<p>"Very nice and friendly. goes the extra mile to ensure our learning and understanding of module. Willing to give consultations to students on his own time and very patient with slow learning students. Writes his own notes to ensure that we have additional knowledge in addition to the lecture and willing to share with the whole cohort." <p>
