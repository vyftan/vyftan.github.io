Oct 2022: Paper on <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12625">Fast Beam Alignment using Pure-Exploration in Multi-Armed Bandits</a> accepted to the <i><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=7693">IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications</a></i>. Joint work with former CSC scholar Yi Wei and Ph.D. student/postdoc <a href="https://zixinzh.github.io/homepage/">Zixin Zhong</a>.

Oct 2022: Posted a paper on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08188">the effect of pseudo-labeling on the generalization error of the semi-supervised Gibbs algorithm</a>. Joint work with <a href="https://haiyunhe.weebly.com/">Haiyun He</a>, <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/iccs/gholamali-aminian">Gholamali Aminian</a>, <a href="https://buyuheng.github.io/">Yuheng Bu</a> and <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/electronic-electrical-engineering/people/dr-miguel-rodrigues">Miguel Rodrigues</a>. We show that  the generalization performance of SSL with pseudo-labeling is affected not only by the information between the output hypothesis and input training data but also by the information shared between the labeled and pseudo-labeled data samples.

Oct 2022: Posted a paper on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07780">Federated Best Arm Identification with Heterogeneous Clients</a>. Joint work with PhD. student Zhirui Chen and postdoc <a href="https://karthikpn.com/">P. N. Karthik</a>. In this paper, we show, among other results, that for any algorithm whose upper bound on the expected time to find the best arms matches with the lower bound up to a multiplicative constant, the ratio of any two consecutive communication time instants must be bounded.

Joint work with Ph.D. student Fengzhuo Zhang and co-authors. In this paper, we present theoretical results justifying the use of transformers in cooperative MARL. We show that, with this choice of architecture, sub-optimality gaps grow independently of the number of agents.

Sep 2022: Paper on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9887955/">Exact Recovery in the General Hypergraph Stochastic Block Model</a> accepted to the <i>IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</i>. This is joint work with former postdoc <a href="https://ericzhang8951.wixsite.com/ericzhang">Qiaosheng Zhang</a>. In this paper, we characterize the fundamental limits for recovering k hidden communities based on an observed hypergraph. The phase transition is represented in terms of a quantity which we term as the generalized Chernoff--Hellinger divergence between communities. Our algorithm consists of a spectral clustering step and successive local refinement steps.

Aug 2022: Paper on <a href="https://jmlr.org/papers/v23/22-0541.html">Information-Theoretic Characterization of the Generalization Error for Iterative Semi-Supervised Learning</a> accepted to the <a href="https://jmlr.org/"><i>Journal of Machine Learning Research</i></a>! This is joint work with Ph.D. students <a href="https://haiyunhe.weebly.com/">Haiyun He</a> and <a href="https://hanshuyan.github.io/">Hanshu Yan</a>. In this paper, we characterize the generalization error of iterative semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms that iteratively generate pseudo-labels for the unlabelled samples. Our theoretical results suggest that when the class conditional variances are not too large, the gen-error decreases with the number of iterations t, but quickly saturates. On the other hand, when the class conditional variances are large, the gen-error increases with t.

Oct 2021: Posted a paper on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00926">information-theoretic generalization bounds for iterative semi-supervised learning</a>. Joint work with Ph.D. students <a href="https://haiyunhe.weebly.com/">Haiyun He</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/hanshuyan/home">Hanshu Yan</a>. In this work, we show, theoretically and empirically, that when the class conditional variances are not too large, the upper bound on the generalization error decreases monotonically with the number of iterations, then quickly saturates.

Sep 2021: Paper on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9558788">third-order asymptotics of variable-length compression allowing errors</a> accepted by the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory. Joint work with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/yuta-sakai">Yuta Sakai</a> (University of Hyogo) and Recep Can Yavas (Caltech). In this paper, we show that the third-order term in the asymptotic expansion for non-prefix-free variable-length compression with errors is -((1-ε)log n)/2, where ε and n are the allowable error probability and blocklength respectively.

Sep 2021: Paper on <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2021/hash/12e086066892a311b752673a28583d3f-Abstract.html">robustifying latent tree learning algorithms with vector variables</a> accepted to NeurIPS 2021. Congrats to Ph.D. student Fengzhuo Zhang on his first paper at NUS. In this paper, we analyze the performance of classical latent tree learning algorithms (such as (Spectral) Neighbor Joining and Chow-Liu Recursive Grouping) when the observations are adversarially corrupted. A novel converse is also developed, showing that the performance bounds are tight in certain asymptotic regimes.
