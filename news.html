Dec 2021: Posted a paper on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04731">class incremental learning (CIL)</a>. Joint work with PhD student <a href="https://yujun-shi.github.io/">Yujun Shi</a> and collaborators. In this paper, we propose a Class-wise Decorrelation regularizer that enables CIL learner at the initial phase to mimic representations produced by the oracle model (the model jointly trained on all classes) and thus boosting the performance of CIL.

Dec 2021: Paper on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11345">unification of Thompson sampling algorithms for risk-aware bandits</a> accepted to <a href="https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-22/">AAAI 2022</a> (15% acceptance rate). Joint work with undergraduate student Joel Chang. In this paper, we design and analyze asymptotically optimal TS-based algorithms for regret minimization in risk-aware bandits. The family of risk measures considered is fairly general, and includes various common ones like the CVaR and the proportional hazard.

Nov 2021: A paper on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9635786/">smooth conditional Rényi entropies</a> accepted by the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory. Joint work with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/yuta-sakai">Yuta Sakai</a>. In this paper, we introduce a new quantity called the conditional smooth-* entropy (the * stands for STAR or <u>S</u>akai–<u>T</u>an–<u>A</u>rimoto–<u>R</u>ényi). This quantity, as well as related notions, turns out to admit operational meanings in terms of the Campbell's source coding problem, the Arıkan–Massey guessing problem, and the Bunte–Lapidoth task encoding problem.

Nov 2021: Posted a paper on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05665">covert communication with mismatched decoding</a>. Joint work with <a href="https://ericzhang8951.wixsite.com/ericzhang">Qiaosheng Zhang</a>. In this paper, we derive bounds on the covert capacity when the decoder is fixed. We deduce, among other things, the covert capacity under the erasures-only decoding metric.

Oct 2021: Posted a paper on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14341">active learning to boost the error exponent of learning homogeneous Ising trees</a>. Joint work with Fengzhuo Zhang and <a href="https://anshootandon.github.io/profile/">Anshoo Tandon</a>. In this work, we use active learning techniques to improve the learnability of homogeneous Ising tree models. We show that for high edge correlations, the error exponent can be improved by at least 40% over its passive counterpart.

Oct 2021: Posted a paper on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08627">Pareto frontier of regret minimization and best arm identification in stochastic bandits</a>. Joint work with <a href="https://zixinzh.github.io/homepage/">Zixin Zhong</a> and <a href="https://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/isem/staff/cheung-wang-chi/">Wang Chi Cheung</a>. In this work, we establish the optimal tradeoff (Pareto frontier) between best arm identification and regret minimization. We also propose an algorithm BOBW-lil-UCB that almost achieves the optimal tradeoff.

Joint work with Ph.D. students <a href="https://haiyunhe.weebly.com/">Haiyun He</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/hanshuyan/home">Hanshu Yan</a>. In this work, we show, theoretically and empirically, that when the class conditional variances are not too large, the upper bound on the generalization error decreases monotonically with the number of iterations, then quickly saturates.

Sep 2021: Paper on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9558788">third-order asymptotics of variable-length compression allowing errors</a> accepted by the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory. Joint work with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/yuta-sakai">Yuta Sakai</a> (University of Hyogo) and Recep Can Yavas (Caltech). In this paper, we show that the third-order term in the asymptotic expansion for non-prefix-free variable-length compression with errors is -((1-ε)log n)/2, where ε and n are the allowable error probability and blocklength respectively.

Sep 2021: Paper on <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2021/hash/12e086066892a311b752673a28583d3f-Abstract.html">robustifying latent tree learning algorithms with vector variables</a> accepted to NeurIPS 2021. Congrats to Ph.D. student Fengzhuo Zhang on his first paper at NUS. In this paper, we analyze the performance of classical latent tree learning algorithms (such as (Spectral) Neighbor Joining and Chow-Liu Recursive Grouping) when the observations are adversarially corrupted. A novel converse is also developed, showing that the performance bounds are tight in certain asymptotic regimes.
