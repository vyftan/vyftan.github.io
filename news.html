Jan 2024: Posted a paper on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09073">Fixed-Budget Differentially Private Best Arm Identification</a>. This is joint work with ISEM Ph.D. student <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MMxA2qAAAAAJ&hl=en">Zhirui Chen</a>, postdoc <a href="https://karthikpn.com/">P. N.

This is joint work with Ph.D. student Fengzhuo Zhang and former postdoc <a href="https://anshootandon.github.io/profile/">Anshoo Tandon</a>. In this work, we use active learning techniques to improve the learnability of homogeneous Ising tree models. We show that for high edge correlations, the error exponent can be improved by at least 40% over its passive counterpart.

Sep 2022: Paper on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9887955/">Exact Recovery in the General Hypergraph Stochastic Block Model</a> accepted to the <i>IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</i>. This is joint work with former postdoc <a href="https://ericzhang8951.wixsite.com/ericzhang">Qiaosheng Zhang</a>. In this paper, we characterize the fundamental limits for recovering k hidden communities based on an observed hypergraph. The phase transition is represented in terms of a quantity which we term as the generalized Chernoff--Hellinger divergence between communities. Our algorithm consists of a spectral clustering step and successive local refinement steps.

Aug 2022: Paper on <a href="https://jmlr.org/papers/v23/22-0541.html">Information-Theoretic Characterization of the Generalization Error for Iterative Semi-Supervised Learning</a> accepted to the <a href="https://jmlr.org/"><i>Journal of Machine Learning Research</i></a>! This is joint work with Ph.D. students <a href="https://haiyunhe.weebly.com/">Haiyun He</a> and <a href="https://hanshuyan.github.io/">Hanshu Yan</a>. In this paper, we characterize the generalization error of iterative semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms that iteratively generate pseudo-labels for the unlabelled samples. Our theoretical results suggest that when the class conditional variances are not too large, the gen-error decreases with the number of iterations t, but quickly saturates. On the other hand, when the class conditional variances are large, the gen-error increases with t.

Sep 2021: Paper on <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2021/hash/12e086066892a311b752673a28583d3f-Abstract.html">robustifying latent tree learning algorithms with vector variables</a> accepted to NeurIPS 2021. Congrats to Ph.D. student Fengzhuo Zhang on his first paper at NUS. In this paper, we analyze the performance of classical latent tree learning algorithms (such as (Spectral) Neighbor Joining and Chow-Liu Recursive Grouping) when the observations are adversarially corrupted. A novel converse is also developed, showing that the performance bounds are tight in certain asymptotic regimes.
